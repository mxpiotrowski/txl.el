* TXL – High-quality machine translation in Emacs via DeepL’s REST API
TXL provides machine translation through DeepL's REST API.

** Installation
TXL is available on [[https://melpa.org/#/txl][MELPA]].  If you’re using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] as your package manager, you can also install directly from this repo using:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(straight-use-package
 '(txl :type git :host github :repo "tmalsburg/txl.el"))
#+END_SRC

Dependencies are:
- [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/guess-language.el][guess-language.el]] (available on [[http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/guess-language.html][ELPA]])
- [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request][request.el]] (available on [[https://melpa.org/#/request][MELPA]])

** Configuration
Minimally, the user needs to specify a pair of languages in the customization variable ~txl-languages~ and an authentication key for DeepL's REST API via ~txl-deepl-api-url~.  (You need the [[https://www.deepl.com/pro?cta=menu-plans/][“developer” subscription]].)  Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'txl)
(setq txl-languages '(DE . EN-US))
(setq txl-deepl-api-key "my-api-key")
#+END_SRC

By default, txl.el assumes that your key is for the DeepL Pro plan.  When the free plan is used instead, txl.el needs to use a different API URL.  The following definition sets this URL:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq txl-deepl-api-url "https://api-free.deepl.com/v2/translate")
#+END_SRC

Other configuration variables are ~txl-deelp-split-sentences~, ~txl-deepl-preserve-formatting~, and ~txl-deepl-formality~.  See inline documentation for details.

For convenience the translation command can be bound to a keyboard shortcut.  Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t")   'txl-translate-region-or-paragraph)
#+END_SRC

** Usage
The command ~txl-translate-region-or-paragraph~ translates the marked region or, if no region is active, the paragraph to the respective other language.  The current language is detected using the ~guess-language~ package.  The retrieved translation is shown in a separate buffer where it can be reviewed and edited.  The original text can be replaced with the (edited) translation via ~C-c C-c~.  The translation can be dismissed (without touching the original text) using ~C-c C-k~.  If a prefix argument is given (~C-u~), the text will be translated round-trip to the other language and back.
